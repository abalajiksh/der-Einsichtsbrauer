- Last week with long holidays was a disaster. Didn’t do anything much.
- I’m loving Elizabeth Gilles in Dynasty. I think I am into sassy, commanding and strong willed woman. She was fabulous in Victorious too.
- I have to find ways to fuel my passion for physics. Should read sorkin on times available. Maybe print everything and file them up after finishing Rovelli LQG series and Algebraic Toopology
