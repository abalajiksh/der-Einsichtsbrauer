- Last week with long holidays was a disaster. Didn’t do anything much.
- I’m loving Elizabeth Gilles in Dynasty. I think I am into sassy, commanding and strong willed woman. She was fabulous in Victorious too.
- I have to find ways to fuel my passion for physics. Should read sorkin on times available. Maybe print everything and file them up after finishing Rovelli LQG series and Algebraic Topology. Should also reread Lee Smolin before his philosophy publication. Lots to do and don’t know when and how to do. Also need to keep up with German Learning.
- And also do exercise everyday. Abs don’t grow in trees, it has to be earned even if it grows on trees.
- Shape Dynamics and Functional Analysis during the break. Finish LQG before that.
