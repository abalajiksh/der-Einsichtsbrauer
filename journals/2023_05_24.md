- Decided to stay back at uni till 4 all days. Sit and study till then. Going back is only springing up exhaustion and hunger. Both are enemies for a theoretical physicist.
- Dynasty season 2 I kinda miss Blake’s second wife. She was awesome, but got more chicks this season.
- Meditations or Realism and Truth? Or Parts of Sorkin? Need to plan to reads and to dos so that I don’t act on impulse. Impulsiveness is a disaster and boon and runs on a fine thread that makes either slip or will cutoff due to unable to support the tension! Said like a true physicist.
