- I have to at least partially come out to my mom about my losing faith in KC.
- I have to reign in my reading lists and control my know it immediately attitude.
- Compare and contrast past and future stuff, like ink feather to typing. What we miss and what we gain. We need to evolve for the future or go back to the past. You have to choose what you want and who you wanna be.
- List all the books I wanna read and then dedicate a month at least for its reading. Also maybe, Sunday reading can enhance reading of long and grudgingly tedious texts like Kant’s Critique.
- You have your whole life to learn. Don’t rush to learn everything. This is side effect of being exposed to  Internet.
- I think these morning pages are working, for I feel free mentally and can work towards particular stuff.
- Do catchup in next two weeks. Please don’t beat yourself up.
- It is okay to be not perfect or late or not to know. Don’t aim perfection, aim for experiences everyday.
- I probably should write down how the day went too. That might help with progress, else this whole thing would be braindump.
