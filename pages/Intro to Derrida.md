- Husserl, for example, describes the condition of 'all modern philosophy' like this:
	- All modern philosophy originates in the Cartesian Meditations... This historical proposition means that every genuine beginning of philosophy issues from meditations, from solitary self-reflection. Autonomous philosophy comes into being in the solitary, radical taking responsibility for himself on the part of the philosopher. Through isolation and meditation alone does a philosopher come into being, does philosophy begin in him.
- One might compare this to Gilbert Ryle's book The Concept of Mind. Although that text is deservedly known for the way it opposes Cartesian construal of subjectivity, its textuality, in another way, affirms it. Famously it has no footnotes at all and no texts by others are appealed to or cited anywhere (not even Descartes'). Less often recalled is that the book has no acknowledgements either. Ryle states instead that he is 'primarily' trying to 'get some disorders out of my own system', and only 'secondarily' interested in helping others.
