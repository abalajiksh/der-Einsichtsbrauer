- You might find it worthwhile to read Einstein's [*Geometry and Experience*](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Einstein_geometry/#:~:text=All%20practical%20geometry%20is%20based,%2Drigid%20body%2C%20a%20tract.) to get some sense of how *he* was thinking about this issue. If you're looking for a Neokantian treatment in the strict sense, the classic is probably Cassirer's *Substance and Function, and Einstein's Theory of Relativity*. For a broader discussion of related philosophical developments on this issue, see Part One of Friedman's *Reconsidering Logical Positivism*. For a technical treatment of the development of these issues up to Cassirer's Neokantian position on them, see Biagioli's *Space, Number, and Geometry from Helmholtz to Cassirer*.
- Hermann Weyl's Continuum grazes a Kantian theme I think. I haven't personally read it, but my research has pointed a lot to Weyl, Brouwer, even HOTT as distant mathematical/physical descendants of a Kantian metaphysics
- The label "Neo-Kantianism" refers to a philosophical movement in Germany during the latter half of the 19th century and early 20th century characterized by the motto “Zurück zu Kant!” "Back to Kant!" It's the movement that, roughly speaking, fills the gap between German Idealism and phenomenology/analytic philosophy.
- The Neo-Kantians were the major rivals of both early analytic and early continental philosophy. Both Husserl and Frege saw themselves to be providing alternatives to the dominant Neo-Kantian paradigm, philosophies that could handle the so-called "crisis" in the foundations of mathematics. Although Neo-Kantianism was extremely influential on the historical development of both analytic and continental philosophy, Neo-Kantianism is unfortunately one of the least studied periods in the history of philosophy.
- The two major schools of this movement are the Marburg School and the Baden School. The names associated with the two main schools of this movement are: Hermann Cohen, Paul Natorp, Ernst Cassirer, Wilhelm Windelband, and Heinrich Rickert. Some of the early (c.1860) figures in this movement are Liebmann, Fischer, Trendelenburg, Helmholtz, and Lange.

- Many people take the famous Davos Debate of 1929 as marking the end of Neo-Kantianism. This debate was between Ernst Cassirer and Martin Heidegger. Heidegger had just published his second book, *Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics*, and *Being and Time* came out only two years earlier. The debate was attended by numerous philosophers, including Levinas, Carnap, and Cavaillès.
- Most people walked away believing Heidegger to have, more or less, wiped the floor with Cassirer. Apparently, this debate was also the source of Carnap's hostility against Heidegger, who he thought to be defending a dangerous form of relativism. The subject matter of the debate basically *is* Neo-Kantianism, so it's worth looking into.
- [Edit: Levinas, it's worth mentioning, went out to a bar with his friends after the debate, where they staged a reenactment. Levinas (who was on Team Heidegger at this point in his life) played the part of Cassirer. While Levinas was doing a rather unflattering impersonation, Cassirer walked into the bar. When Heidegger joined the Nazi party and became Levinas' main target, he regretted siding with Heidegger against Cassirer, and carried the guilt and embarrassment for this incident with him throughout his life, formally apologizing to Cassirer's wife after the philosopher's death.]
