- "There has been a lot of freedom of thought over the past few years, but no thought. Rather like the case of a child who, not having any meat, asks for salt with which to season it."
- speech vs writing vs obsession with certainty
- socrates never trusted the written form
	- plato's books are written in socratic dialogues
	- phaedrus - athenian aristocrat
		- socrates - does writing convey more truth to you than if i just conveyed it verbally via speech to you?
		- socrates - egyptian myth of king Phineus and God of Writing thieweth
			- Phineus said writing makes Egyptian stupider
				- no need to reason on their feet
				- no need to utilise the faculties on the spot
				- no need to say something on the face of a person to confront something
- writing without a father - writing without the presence of the writer cannot defend itself
	- asking sister to buy a list of items
		- write and hand it
			- escapes original intention
		- say it to her
	- writing always has its misinterpretation element to it.
	- speech's margin of error is narrower
- paranoia for writing
	- Aristotle coined writing to be defective, a symbol for speaking
	- French Enlightenment Philosopher - Jean Jaques Rosseau - writing is dangerous supplement to speaking
- our first instinct to learn about a topic is in the medium of speech.
	- youtube video
	- blog post
	- podcast
	- tiktok etc
		- these sources add to the glamour and charisma of the speaker that once we take the person to be the authority, it is difficult to break out of it
- Summer of 1965 - Jaques Derrida - cruise ship to Venice - Of grammatology book - linguistics to phenomenology to chinese alphabets to spelling systems of ancient civilizations
	- One key themes was to resolve the dichotomy of writing and speaking
	- trying to fix the truth to statement - try to derive objective meaning
		- we are necessarily excluding other possible interpretations
		- act of fixing is in a sense act of violence - you are excluding all the other possible meanings
			- eg a taxidermist - pin down a butterfly in the board. we are getting a stable structure of the butterfly but we are excluding it's movements and natural cycles - for the sake of stable structure - a dead butterfly
			- philosopher defining a mug - pinning down to one interpretation and excluding other ambiguities of life
		- act of fixing makes us enter a state called Differance - a state of deferring meanings till later
	- differance is going to give rise to aporia(Greeks coined it) - state of confusion about something
		- aporia - state of doubting our own reason
- process of learning by necessity should go through the state of aporia
	- reality is lot bigger than our frame of view of the reality
	- new information is going to throw off our world view
		- it is a good thing
	- but our impulse is to run to internet to find an answer
	- Derrida prescribes to embrace the state of aporia

		- deal with it
		- think more about it
		- read about it
		- watch a few youtube videos
	- once we acknowledge that we don't know about it, that is when we are most open-minded
		- this is the perfect state of dealing with new information
	- try to put ourself in a state of deferring the meaning for later
		- because once we fix, we are fixed forever
