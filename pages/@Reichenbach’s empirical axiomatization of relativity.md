- [[Abstract]]
	- A well known conception of axiomatization has it that an axiomatized theory must be interpreted, or otherwise coordinated with reality, in order to acquire empirical content. An early version of this account is often ascribed to key ﬁgures in the logical empiricist movement, and to central ﬁgures in the early “formalist” tradition in mathematics as well. In this context, Reichenbach’s “coordinative deﬁnitions” are regarded as investing abstract propositions with empirical signiﬁcance. We argue that over-emphasis on the abstract elements of this approach fails to appreciate a rich tradition of empirical axiomatization in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, evident in particular in the work of Moritz Pasch, Heinrich Hertz, David Hilbert, and Reichenbach himself. We claim that such over-emphasis leads to a misunderstanding of the role of empirical facts in Reichenbach’s approach to the axiomatization of a physical theory, and of the role of Reichenbach’s coordinative deﬁnitions in particular.

- § 1.Introduction
	- coordinative definitions -> correspondence rules -> epistemic correlations -> operational definitions
	- uninterpreted postulate system -> empirical facts : the connector is coordinative definitions
- § 2
	- need for axiomatization -> messy ways the theories are usually developed
	- empirical claims, conventional choices and mathematical artefacts

	- the axioms of our presentation are empirical propositions - Reichenbach
	- The physical definition takes the meaning of the concept for granted and coordinates to it a physical thing; it is a coordinative definition. Physical definitions, therefore, consist in the coordination of a mathematical definition to a „piece of reality“; one might call them real definitions. (ATR. 8)
