- any activity that doesn't activate love of godhead is useless
- statements in srimad bhagavatam is about us, about the world we live in, it is about the temporary nature we live in.
- being solidly situated in platform of self, who are you, why are you here and what are you doing here?
- in that state, we can operate on our occupational duty
- we are in world of maya - prison house
- we should reconnect by process of bhakti yoga
- our best identity comes out when we start relating with the personality of godhead
- we have meaning on our life only when we relate with other people
- blossoming our identity by expressing our relationship to krishna
- Bharata Muni - natyasastra - theory of rasa
- rasa is an exchange - occurs only with conscious living entities
- deep analysis of why human beings do what they do?
	- because they enjoy doing it
- we all live for rasa
	- we seek rasa in every relationship
		- including relationship with cows and dogs
- if we have relationship with krishna - we start enjoying the rasa
