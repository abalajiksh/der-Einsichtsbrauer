title:: Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self Delusion

- #book
- These are the prisms through which I have come to know myself. In this book, I tried to undo their acts of refraction. 1 wanted to see the way I would see in a mirror. It’s possible I painted an elaborate mural instead. But that’s fine. The last few years have taught me to suspend my desire for a conclusion, to assume that nothing is static and that renegotiation will be perpetual, to hope primarily that little truths will keep emerging in time.
