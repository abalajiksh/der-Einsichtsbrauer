- Hilbert variational approach uses tensors. Palatani action uses frames ( but they are tensors anyway). Hoyle- Narlikar derived Einstein's equations through a different route of action at a distance approach ( Introduction to cosmology). There is again the Hamiltonian approach to general relativity, which uses Cauchy surface and some shift/lapse functions. There is again a research paper that I came across titled “ General relativity in terms of Dirac eigenvalues". This paper avoids tensors altogether. But the physics is very opaque (atleast to me). Again one Rene Schmidt recast general relativity in terms of algebraic geometry in his arXiv paper, termed as arithmetic gravity. This takes approach to schemes and describes gravity in terms of schemes. Penrose uses twistors to describe general relativity. But twistors are “ generalizations” of tensors loosely speaking. NP formalism uses spinors instead of tensors to describe general relativity, but the mathematics is very involved.
