- dangers of subscribing to mainstream ideas about liberal arts
- dangers of seduction of liberal arts, literature, philosophy etc fields by influencers
- derrida - deconstruction - french philosopher
	- when reading - we look for objective meaning
	- 2002 - deconstruction of philosophical literature - ironic forms of storytelling - analogy/parallel? asked by journalist
		- seinfeld - a sitcom whose protagonist searches for meaning
		- switch of tv, do the homework and read
	- dangers of popularizing content in mainstream
- academic concepts - do not popularize
- "The reasonably diligent study of [the liberal arts] over a period of years, **under the guidance of an experienced tutor**, will develop in you a critical and sceptical habit of mind which will be of service to you in assessing whatever you hear or read." P. Strawson, Why Philosophy?
	- train the brain to make coherent sense of an information presented to us
	- knowledge work opens us up to new possibilities that we never thought about in the first place
- Influencers $\neq$ Professors
	- Problem of Received Ideas
	- Christopher Bell - A dictionary of Received Ideas
	- newspapers - arm stupidity and giving authority to force
	- popularizes the partial readings of wholly comprehendable concepts, it shrinks it down and that circulates everywhere
	- social media is shifting the where is the idea from to the presentation of the presenter
		- the presenter aesthetics is more appreciated than the idea itself.
		- presentation aesthetics creates an illusion of authority over the subject discussed
		- forget the true source of the idea
- The real work of engaging with liberal arts is very much many hours of unglamorous work.
- reading philosophy is not always sunshine and butterflies, there is a period of banging heads, losing grip to reality etc, and taking ourselves to authority to learn from them
